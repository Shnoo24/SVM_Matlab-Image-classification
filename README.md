# Image Classification Project With SVM Algorithm Using Matlab IDE
This Code is using these Dataset from Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdkabinhasan/sports-ball-dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/sports-balls-multiclass-image-classification
These are the sources but i would recommedn to get the dataset from this link 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N1jnVj3bFiaJ0mfea_Aaa5cdQZKA3WxD/view?usp=drive_link
because I am using csv for reading the paths 
We used SVM (Support Vector Machine ) Algorithm to Classify to Classes of Sports-Balls 
1- BasketBall
2- FootBall
This Method Could be used for multiclasses but for saving time in live present and to achieve the best result in this project.
